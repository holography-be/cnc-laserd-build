========================================

I'm still learning how to use Eagle and wasn't able to find these library definitions elsewhere.

Included components are as follows:

* [Pololu MinIMU9 v2](http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/1268)
* [Pololu DRV8835 Dual Motor Driver Carrier](http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/2135)
